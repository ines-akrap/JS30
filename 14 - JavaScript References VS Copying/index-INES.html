    // The same thing goes for objects => PASS BY REFERENCE

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

    const personAssign = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
